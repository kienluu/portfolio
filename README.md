## Compile for production
This code will compile the javascript and sass files:
```
./production-build.js
```

## Compile sass for dev
Compile with debug info when developing.  If using this with Chrome (Canary)
sass support, there will be a link to go straight to the file in chromes dev tools
with the ability to edit and update sass live (no page reload needed).
```
compass watch --debug
```
